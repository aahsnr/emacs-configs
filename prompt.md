Write a comprehensive completion setup for vanilla emacs 30 using corfu, cape, embark, consult, embark-consult, marginalia, vertico, and dabbrev while integrating these packages together. Use the use-package format and integrate the configuration with tokyo-night theme from doom-themes, assuming that doom-themes is already setup. Also integrate with org-src-code blocks assuming org is present in the user's configuration. Also assume package management has also been setup.  Use spacemacs keybindings under leader using general.el. Use  hex codes directly instead of using variables for the themes integration. Integrate nerd-icons into the completion system as well using nerd-icons-completion, nerd-icons-corfu. Integrate tokyo-night theme into the nerd-icons and use hex codes directly for this. Do not include project.el, projectile, ibuffer, dired, perspective integrations. Then further enhance the configuration. 



Add wgrep to the integration

Write a comphrensive helpful  configuration for emacs 30 using https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful. Strictly setup only helpful and nothing else. You may setup anything that only complements the helpful package. Use the use-package format. And use general.el using SPC as leader for the keybindings. You may use the attached file containing the completion system for any suggestions or ideas.
