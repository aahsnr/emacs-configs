Write a comprehensive ligatures and unicode configuration for emacs 30 only setup this configuration for org-mode, text-mode, and latex mode. Use the use-package format to setup the configuration, assuming that the user already has a working emacs configuration.  Make sure to search the web before writing the configuration. I prefer using built-in packages in emacs. Also make sure the configuration works in emacs daemon mode.
