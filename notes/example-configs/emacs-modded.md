Of course. I have analyzed your Emacs configuration with the goal of aligning it more closely with the features and behavior of Doom Emacs.

Your current setup is excellent and already embraces many core Doom principles, such as the `SPC` leader key, extensive `evil-mode` integration, and reliance on powerful tools like `projectile`, `magit`, and `doom-themes`. The following suggestions are intended to refine this foundation, reduce redundancy, and adopt some of the subtle but effective conventions that define the Doom experience.

### **Emacs Configuration Review: Aligning with Doom Emacs**

Here is a summary of the recommended changes to make your configuration more "Doom-like".

***

#### **1. Unify and Refine the Completion Framework**

You have two separate `(use-package consult ...)` blocks. This can lead to conflicting settings and makes the configuration harder to maintain. It's best to merge them into a single, coherent block. This new block will prioritize `ripgrep` (a Doom staple) and unify your keybindings and sources.

**Suggested Change:**

Replace both of your `use-package consult` blocks with this single, unified version:

```el
(use-package consult
  :hook (completion-list-mode . consult-preview-at-point-mode)
  :bind
  ;; Core bindings for universal access
  ("C-s" . consult-line)
  ("C-x b" . consult-buffer)
  ("M-x" . consult-M-x)
  ("C-h a" . consult-apropos)

  :custom
  ;; --- Doom-like Settings ---
  ;; Use '<' for narrowing, a common convention
  (consult-narrow-key "<")
  ;; Use ripgrep for file searching (find) and content searching (grep)
  (consult-find-args "rg --null --line-buffered --color=never --files --hidden --smart-case --no-ignore-vcs -g '!.git'")
  (consult-ripgrep-args "rg --null --line-buffered --color=never --smart-case --no-heading --line-number --search-zip")
  ;; Automatically preview on any key press, a signature Doom feature
  (consult-preview-key 'any)
  ;; Keep the preview advice from your original configuration
  (register-preview-delay 0.5)
  (advice-add #'register-preview :override #'consult-register-window)

  :config
  ;; Augment the buffer sources to include recent files and bookmarks for a powerful switcher
  (setq consult-buffer-sources
        '(consult--source-buffer
          consult--source-project-buffer
          consult--source-recent-file
          consult--source-project-recent-file
          consult--source-bookmark))

  ;; Configure preview keys for various commands.
  (consult-customize
   consult-theme :preview-key '(:debounce 0.05 any)
   consult-ripgrep consult-git-grep consult-grep
   consult-bookmark consult-recent-file consult-xref
   consult--source-bookmark consult--source-file-register
   consult--source-recent-file consult--source-project-recent-file
   :preview-key '(:debounce 0.1 any)))
```

***

#### **2. Resolve Keybinding Conflicts & Refine Leader Keys**

Your leader key setup is great, but there is a direct conflict. You bind the `o` prefix to "open" for Treemacs, and later to "org" for Org mode. Doom Emacs typically reserves major prefixes for specific modes. Let's resolve this and align a few other bindings.

**Suggested Changes:**

1.  **Treemacs:** Change the leader prefix from `o` and `f` to `t` for "tree". This is a common pattern in Doom-like configs and frees up `o` for Org mode.
2.  **Org Mode:** Change your Org leader bindings from `n` ("notes") to `o r` ("org roam") for better namespacing.
3.  **File Management:** Add the canonical `SPC f f` binding for finding files, which is a core part of Doom's muscle memory.

**Modified `treemacs` keybindings:**

```el
;; --- Keybindings ---
(ar/global-leader
  "t" '(:ignore t :which-key "tree")
  "t t" '(treemacs :wk "toggle treemacs")
  "t f" '(treemacs-find-file :wk "find file in treemacs")
  "t d" '(treemacs-find-dir :wk "find directory in treemacs"))
```

**Modified `org` and `org-roam` keybindings:**

```el
(ar/global-leader
  ;; General File/M-x bindings
  "f f" '(projectile-find-file :wk "find file") ; Use projectile's find-file
  ;; Org-mode specific bindings
  "o" '(:ignore t :which-key "org")
  "o a" '(org-agenda :wk "agenda")
  "o c" '(org-capture :wk "capture")
  "o s" '(org-schedule :wk "schedule")
  "o d" '(org-deadline :wk "deadline")
  "o t" '(org-set-tags-command :wk "set tags")

  ;; Org-roam specific bindings under "org roam"
  "o r" '(:ignore t :which-key "roam")
  "o r f" '(org-roam-node-find :wk "find node")
  "o r i" '(org-roam-node-insert :wk "insert node")
  "o r c" '(org-roam-capture :wk "roam capture")
  "o r g" '(org-roam-graph :wk "show graph")
  "o r t" '(org-roam-tag-add :wk "add tag"))
```

***

#### **3. Streamline Org Mode Configuration**

Your Org setup is extensive. We can make it more robust and maintainable with two changes: de-duplicating the Babel config and making your capture templates more portable.

**Suggested Changes:**

1.  **Unify Babel Config:** You have two `with-eval-after-load 'org` blocks for Babel, one of which is commented out. Consolidate them into a single, clean block.
2.  **Portable Capture Templates:** Your capture templates use hardcoded paths like `~/org/inbox.org`. By using your `my/org-directory` variable, your configuration becomes instantly portable.

**Unified Babel and Structure Templates Block:**

```el
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Load common languages for Babel.
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     (python . t)
     (shell . t)))

  ;; Set default header arguments for all src blocks.
  (setq-default org-babel-default-header-args
                '((:session . "none")
                  (:results . "output replace")
                  (:exports . "code")
                  (:cache . "no")
                  (:noweb . "no")
                  (:hlines . "no")
                  (:tangle . "no")))
  
  ;; Setup structure templates
  (require 'org-tempo)
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("sh" . "src shell"))
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("el" . "src emacs-lisp"))
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("py" . "src python")))
```

**Revised and Portable `org-capture-templates`:**

*Note: Replace `~/org/` with `my/org-directory`.*

```el
(use-package org-capture
  :ensure nil
  :after org
  :custom
  (org-capture-templates
   `(("t" "📥 Task" entry (file+headline (expand-file-name "inbox.org" my/org-directory) "Tasks")
      "* 📥 TODO %?\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :CREATED: %U\n  :END:\n")

     ("n" "📝 Note" entry (file+headline (expand-file-name "inbox.org" my/org-directory) "Notes")
      "* %? :note:\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :CREATED: %U\n  :SOURCE: \n  :END:\n")

     ("j" "📔 Journal" entry (file+datetree (expand-file-name "journal.org" my/org-directory))
      "* %U %?\n")
     ;; ... and so on for the rest of your templates ...
     ("p" "📝 Project" entry (file+headline (expand-file-name "projects.org" my/org-directory) "Projects")
      "* 📝 PLAN %? :project:\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :CREATED: %U\n  :GOAL: \n  :DEADLINE: \n  :END:\n** Goals\n** Tasks\n*** 📥 TODO Define project scope\n** Resources\n** Notes\n")
     )))
```

***

#### **4. Clean Up Minor Redundancies**

A few packages are configured more than once. Combining these makes the init file cleaner.

1.  **evil-surround:** You have two `(use-package evil-surround ...)` blocks.
2.  **org-pdftools:** The `(use-package org-pdftools ...)` block has a typo `org-open-link-functions` which should be `org-open-at-point-functions`.

**Suggested Changes:**

Remove the second, smaller `evil-surround` block entirely. The first one is sufficient:

```el
;; This is the only block you need for evil-surround
(use-package evil-surround
  :hook (evil-mode . global-evil-surround-mode))
```

Correct the `org-pdftools` configuration:

```el
(use-package org-pdftools
  :after org
  :config
  ;; This ensures that when you call `org-open-at-point` on a pdf link,
  ;; it opens the pdf and highlights the linked region.
  (add-to-list 'org-open-at-point-functions 'org-pdftools-open-link)

  ;; Set the prefix for pdftools links in Org mode.
  (setq org-pdftools-link-prefix "pdf"))
```

By implementing these changes, your Emacs configuration will not only be more robust and maintainable but will also feel even closer to the highly-integrated and efficient experience that Doom Emacs provides.Of course.
