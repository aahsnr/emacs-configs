- [ ] __LaTeX__: [Add laas, auto-activating-snippets, cdlatex]
Using the attached config.el file as the base emacs configuration, write a comprehensive setup for writing latex documents in emacs. Integrate tectonic from https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic into the LaTeX writing environment, as well as integrate texlab from https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab as the lsp backend. As a result, the LaTeX writing environment would use both these methods seamlessly and interchangeably where possible.  Also integrate org-mode and org-roam into the LaTeX writing environment. Make sure I have the ability to write LaTeX documents both in org mode files as well as separate LaTeX. Try to mimic the setup from doom emacs setup as closely as possible while not adding any redundant configuration options. Furthermore, setup ligatures for LaTeX with additional math ligaturs, and make sure to setup cdlatex for quick math insertions, as well as make sure to setup laas and auto-activating-snippets. Also setup custom snippets that might be useful to quickly format and write LaTeX documents both in LaTeX files and org-mode files. Additionally setup TeX-fold if writing separate LaTeX files.  Check if the resulting latex writing environment benefits from using the parsebib package. Only integrate parsebib if it complements the resulting latex writing environment. Further, use pdf-tools as the default pdf viewer when compiling LaTeX files. Implement a robust citation and reference environment citar-embark and citar-capf, as well as,org-roam-bibtex and citar-org-roam.

Make sure to search the web before writing anything. Do not introduce errors. And keep in mind that the attached config.el file is formatted as an org file. And only show the parts about this LaTeX writing environment.
